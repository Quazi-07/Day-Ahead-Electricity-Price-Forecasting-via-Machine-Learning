# Day-Ahead-Electricity-Price-Forecasting-via-Machine-Learning

Electricity price forecasting is the curial step to optimize energy efficiency in the electricity market. However, due to the sophistication in electricity price prediction, the accurately 24-hour electricity price forecasting is the one of the key factors to increase efficiency and economics of the power plants. In this project, the model includes variational mode decomposition (VMD), long short-term memory (LSTM). The dataset that we used in this study is one-year hourly 2020 California Independent System Operator (CAISO) dataset. The model performance illustrated that mean absolute error is 0.0766. The results illustrated that VMD-LSTM model electricity price forecasting is significantly accurate and stable.
